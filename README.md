    Project summary and the "problem" it solved:
Website for an upscale Chinese restaurant that caters to customers with a taste for traditional cuisine. The target demographic is customers within the age range of 30-60 who desire a classy space for personal dining and events.

    What was done well:
Throught the website I made use of key words like “Chinese cuisine” and “high-end dining” for for branding and SEO. The brand color palett utilized a vibrant red as the primary color and muted earth tones for the secondary colors. Since the primary color has a high contrast I featured it in the hero elements within each page, including the navigation header.

    Where could be enhanced or improved to make the code more efficient: 
Becuase it is a restaurant website, a high volume of users will use their mobile devices to check the site for the menu, hours, and make reservations. With that being the case, the webiste needs to have a more responsive layout for smaller those smaller screen sizes.
    
    Most challenging pieces of the code to write, and the tools or resources that could be utilized:
My goal was to create a website that can be fully responsive with the size of any window. As it is an unfamiliar practice for me, I struggled implementing this within the pages that contained multiple rows and columns.

    Transferable skills that will benefit other projects:
The planning process, which inclued customer predictions and brand identity, was incredibly educational. I enjoyed creating user personas and using them to prioritize allocation of design and development resources.
